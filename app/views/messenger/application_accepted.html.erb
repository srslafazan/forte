            Congratulations! We reviewed your application and think you’ll make a fantastic addition to the Academy.  Now that you’ve been accepted, we’ve begun the process of identifying the perfect [student/teacher] for you.  As soon as we find a potential match, we will reach out with a lesson proposal!
